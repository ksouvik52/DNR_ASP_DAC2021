#### To test adversarial accuracy of a saved model, please:
1. Copy and bring the model to same location as the *.py files.
2. Open the run_test.py file to change model_type ['resnet18' or 'vgg16'] and provide the dataset='cifar10'.
3. Provide --adv_eval to enable adversarial evaluation.
4. Run python file: 'python run_test.py'
